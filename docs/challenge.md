## Part I

#### Notebook Exploration and Bug Fixing: `barplot` errors
Original version:
```python
sns.barplot(flights_by_airline.index, flights_by_airline.values, alpha=0.9)
```

Fixted version
```python
sns.barplot(x=flights_by_airline.index, y=flights_by_airline.values, alpha=0.9)
```

### Model Selection and Final Decision

The selection of the final model was based on the results of the six trained models. After evaluating their metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy), it was concluded that:

- XGBoost and Logistic Regression achieved the best and very similar results.
- Reducing the features to the top 10 most important did not degrade model performance.
- Balancing the classes significantly improved recall for the minority class ("1").

Considering these points, the **Logistic Regression model with the 10 most important features and class balancing (`reg_model_2`)** was chosen for its simplicity, computational efficiency, and comparable performance to XGBoost. This decision ensures an interpretable and robust solution for practical deployment.

### Saving the Final Model

The selected model, `reg_model_2`, was saved using `joblib`. The choice of `joblib` over `pickle` was due to its efficiency in handling large numerical arrays, which are commonly present in machine learning models. Below is the code used to save the model:

```python
# Save models reg_model_2 using joblib 
import joblib
joblib.dump(reg_model_2, 'reg_model_2.pkl')
```


## Part II

### Deploy the Model in an API (Framework FastAPI).

To deploy the `reg_model_2` Logistic Regression model. This API provides endpoints for health checks and predictions. The implementation is modular, ensuring clarity and scalability.

#### FastAPI Structure

1. **`api.py`**:
   - Initializes the FastAPI application.
   - Defines endpoints for health checks (`/health`) and predictions (`/predict`).
   - Uses the `DelayModel` class to load the trained model and preprocess inputs.

2. **`model.py`**:
   - Contains the `DelayModel` class for:
     - Preprocessing input data.
     - Loading the trained model using `joblib`.
     - Predicting delays for new inputs.

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - **`/health`**: Returns the API's health status (`status: OK`).
   - **`/predict`**: Accepts flight information (`OPERA`, `TIPOVUELO`, `MES`) and returns delay predictions.

    Example json:
   ```
   [
     {
       "OPERA": "LATAM",
       "TIPOVUELO": "Internacional",
       "MES": 5
     },
     {
       "OPERA": "Avianca",
       "TIPOVUELO": "Nacional",
       "MES": 12
     }
   ]
    ```
### Required Libraries

The following libraries are required to run the API:

- `FastAPI`: To create the RESTful API.
- `Pydantic`: For input data validation.
- `Uvicorn`: ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
- `Pandas`: For handling and preprocessing tabular data.
- `Joblib`: For loading the trained Logistic Regression model.
- `Scikit-learn`: For the Logistic Regression model.

### Running the API

To run the API, use the following command:
```
uvicorn challenge.api:app --reload
```
